## React Native POCS

This repository contains various Proof of Concept (PoC) projects developed in React Native using Expo.

### Projects
Here are the available pocs in this repository:

1. Management States

Explore different techniques and libraries for state management in React Native. Demonstrate the use of popular libraries such as Redux, MobX, or Context API and how to apply these solutions to efficiently manage the application state.

2. Bridges

Address the concepts of communication between JavaScript code and native code in React Native. Explore React Native's bridge capabilities, enabling interaction with native APIs and integration with third-party native libraries.

3. New React Concepts

Highlight the latest concepts in React, including Hooks, Context API, Suspense, Error Boundaries, and more. Demonstrate how to utilize these features to build reusable components and optimize the rendering of React Native applications.

4. New RN Concepts

Focus on the latest React Native-specific concepts. Explore the recent updates in the framework, such as new components, APIs, and tools that can enhance the development experience and application performance.

5. Gateway Payments

Demonstrate the integration of payment gateways in React Native applications. Explore different payment options, such as PayPal, Stripe, Mercado Pago, and others, and showcase how to implement these solutions securely and efficiently.

6. Software Architecture (Clean Architecture, MVVM)

Address software architecture concepts applied to React Native app development. Introduce patterns like Clean Architecture and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and demonstrate how to apply them to create a scalable, modular, and easily maintainable code structure.

7. CI/CD (Github Actions, AppCenter, Fastlane, CircleCI)

Explore continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices for React Native applications. Demonstrate various tools such as Github Actions, AppCenter, Fastlane, and CircleCI, and how to configure automation pipelines to compile, test, and deploy applications efficiently.

8. Code-push

Explore the CodePush feature of Expo, allowing remote JavaScript code updates for React Native applications without the need to submit a new version to app stores. Show how to implement CodePush to provide quick and continuous updates to users.

9. Firebase Services

Explore the services offered by Firebase for React Native applications. Present features like user authentication, cloud storage, real-time database, push notifications, and data analytics, and demonstrate how to integrate them efficiently into a React Native app.

10. CMS

Address the integration of a Content Management System (CMS) into React Native applications. Explore popular solutions like WordPress or Contentful and demonstrate how to utilize these platforms to manage and display dynamic content in a React Native app.

11. Conventional Commits with Lints

Present the practices of conventional commits with the use of linters in a React Native environment. Demonstrate how to follow commit conventions, such as using Conventional Commits, and how to integrate linting tools to ensure code consistency and quality.

12. Push Notifications

Explore the implementation of push notifications in React Native applications. Demonstrate different solutions like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal and how to configure sending and receiving push notifications in a React Native app.

13. Tests

Address testing practices in React Native applications. Explore different types of tests such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, and how to utilize tools like Jest and Detox to ensure the quality and stability of the app.
